# qTimeLineEditor

It's a graphical time line editor to help create and prototype animation. It's originally created to import visual Fxs to different parts of a real time presentation software. You can add in/out fxs   

It is built primary for myself, but its abandoned, so you may find bugs or non working parts. Anyway feel free to send me suggestions or requests.



Timeliner is a graphical graphical tool to help create and prototype animations quickly. It is useful for adjusting variables and checking out how the effects changes over time with keyframing and easing/tweening functions. It may also have some similarities with the timeline component of adobe flash, after effects, edge animate or other animation software.

It is written in javascript and meant to work with different javascript libraries or webgl frameworks, in 1d, 2d, or 3d. It is built primary for myself, but feel free to send me suggestions or requests.

Enjoy.
